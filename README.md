# Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life, the second-to-final project of my AP Computer Science class, circa 2014. This was originally destined for [/dev/null](https://github.com/jkmartindale/dev-null), but after going through the code I realized this was rather polished for something written by a novice programmer. The program is also of more interest than the code itself, which also invalidates it for /dev/null. However, it is still incomplete. If I remember correctly, there's some bug related to custom gamerules.
